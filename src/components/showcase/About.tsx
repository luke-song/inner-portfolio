                <p>
                    From a young age, I've always been intrigued by how things
                    functioned. This curiosity naturally led me to the world of
                    web development, a realm where creation and logic
                    intertwine. My first real encounter with programming began
                    in high school during a Web Development 101 class, learning
                    how to scrape and interact with websites.

                    I went on to do a ton of passion projects, many of them with
                    one of my closest friends,{' '}

                    . We worked on many projects together, including donation
                    app, multiple web apps, and more. One of these projects is

                    In 2017, I got accepted into San Jose State University to
                    study Software Engineering. At the end of my freshman year,
                    I got an internship working for the startup Spot Me
                    Solutions, primarily focusing on frontend work. I continued
                    to work at Spot Me Solutions on and off for about a year,
                    until the end of my junior year when I decided to join
                    identity.com. I worked at identity.com for over a half a
                    year, and then was offered to join interview rocket as
                    frontend engineer.

                            Beyond software, I have a lot of hobbies that I
                            enjoy doing in my free time. The more tangible
                            hobbies I have are{' '}

                            pages under my projects tab. Some other hobbies I
                            enjoy are working out, cooking, and (unsurprisingly)
                            playing video games.

                            In college, I was an active member in the IDEAS LAB

                            clubs. I met a lot of amazing people through my club
                            activities and thoroughly enjoyed the community.
